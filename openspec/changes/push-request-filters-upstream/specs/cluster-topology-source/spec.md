## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Topology series consumed

The topology reader SHALL consume at minimum the following `kube-state-metrics` series, each carrying a `cluster` external label. The bracketed tag after each series names the request-scoped matchers it receives (see "Request-scoped upstream selectors"): **[AECN]** = `az`, `env`, `cluster`, `namespace`; **[AEC]** = `az`, `env`, `cluster`.

- `kube_pod_info{cluster, namespace, pod, uid, node, pod_ip, host_ip, ...}` **[AECN]** (`pod_ip` and `host_ip` are surfaced when present)
- `kube_node_info{cluster, node, ...}` **[AEC]**
- `kube_node_status_addresses{cluster, node, type=~"ExternalIP|InternalIP", address, ...}` **[AEC]** (the anchored alternation selects exactly the two address types; ExternalIP is preferred and InternalIP is the fallback for the node `ipaddress` attribute)
- `kube_pod_spec_volumes_persistentvolumeclaims_info{cluster, namespace, pod, volume, claim_name, ...}` **[AECN]**
- `kube_node_labels{cluster, node, label_*, ...}` **[AEC]**
- `kube_service_info{cluster, namespace, service, cluster_ip, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the service/endpoint indexes)
- `kube_endpointslice_endpoints{cluster, namespace, endpointslice, address, targetref_kind, targetref_name, targetref_namespace, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the service/endpoint indexes)
- `kube_endpointslice_labels{cluster, namespace, endpointslice, label_kubernetes_io_service_name, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — joins each slice back to its owning service)
- `kube_pod_owner{cluster, namespace, pod, owner_kind, owner_name, owner_is_controller, argocd_tracking_id, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the pod controller-owner labels and, via the `argocd_tracking_id` label, the pod ArgoCD Application attribute)
- `kube_replicaset_owner{cluster, namespace, replicaset, owner_kind, owner_name, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — resolves a ReplicaSet pod owner up to its owning Deployment)
- `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_info{cluster, namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, storageclass, volumename, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the PVC `storageclass` attribute and — via the `volumename` label — the PVC `volumename` label that roots the NetApp Harvest join defined by the `netapp-storage-graph` capability)
- `kube_pod_container_info{cluster, namespace, pod, uid, container, image, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the per-pod container list attribute; one series per container)
- `kube_node_status_condition{cluster, node, condition="Ready", status, ...}` **[AEC]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the K8s node `ready_status` attribute; the `condition="Ready"` selector is a fixed, request-invariant metric-selection contract, and the `status` label carries `true`/`false`/`unknown` **matched case-insensitively** — stock kube-state-metrics lowercases the value, but an exporter re-publishing the raw Kubernetes `v1.ConditionStatus` enum verbatim emits `True`/`False`/`Unknown` — with the active row's sample value being `1`)
- `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_annotations{cluster, namespace, persistentvolumeclaim, annotation_argocd_argoproj_io_tracking_id, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the PVC ArgoCD Application attribute; the `annotation_argocd_argoproj_io_tracking_id` label is kube-state-metrics' sanitised form of the `argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id` annotation and requires the operator's `--metric-annotations-allowlist=persistentvolumeclaims=[argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id]`)
- `kube_service_annotations{cluster, namespace, service, annotation_argocd_argoproj_io_tracking_id, ...}` **[AECN]** (OPTIONAL — feeds the service ArgoCD Application attribute; the `annotation_argocd_argoproj_io_tracking_id` label requires the operator's `--metric-annotations-allowlist=services=[argocd.argoproj.io/tracking-id]`)

The kubelet volume-stats series of the "PVC usage from kubelet volume stats" requirement are **[AECN]**. The NetApp Harvest series of the `netapp-storage-graph` capability receive `az` and `env` only.

Every series above SHALL be queried at its bare (unprefixed) name — there is no configurable metric-name prefix. A request with no selector-level filter SHALL issue each query exactly as listed, with no request-scoped matcher.

The three service/endpointslice families are OPTIONAL: when absent (kube-state-metrics not exporting services or endpointslices), the reader SHALL still build a valid topology, the service/endpoint indexes are simply empty, and connection-string resolution in the pod-service-graph reader degrades gracefully — `"://"` service endpoints that cannot be resolved against an empty index become `external/<label>` nodes. Under a selector-level filter the indexes hold only the in-scope services and the in-scope backing pods.

`kube_persistentvolumeclaim_info` is likewise OPTIONAL: when absent — or when no series matches a given PVC — the reader SHALL still build a valid topology, the affected PVC entities carry no `storageclass` attribute, no `volumename` label (and hence no `svm` label and no `pvc-to-netapp-aggr` edge — see the `netapp-storage-graph` capability), and the Cytoscape serialiser nests those PVCs under their namespace group (`cluster > namespace > pvc`) like any other PVC.

`kube_pod_container_info` is likewise OPTIONAL: when absent — or when no series matches a given pod — the reader SHALL still build a valid topology, the affected pod entities carry no `containers` attribute, and the build does not fail. The `argocd_tracking_id` label on `kube_pod_owner` is likewise OPTIONAL: when absent, the affected pod entities carry no `application` attribute and the build does not fail.

`kube_node_status_condition` is likewise OPTIONAL: when absent — or when no `condition="Ready"` series matches a given node — the reader SHALL still build a valid topology, the affected K8s node entities carry no `ready_status` attribute, and the build does not fail.

`kube_persistentvolumeclaim_annotations` and `kube_service_annotations` are likewise OPTIONAL: when absent — or when no series matches a given `(cluster, namespace, claim)` / `(cluster, namespace, service)`, or its `annotation_argocd_argoproj_io_tracking_id` label is empty — the reader SHALL still build a valid topology, the affected PVC / service entities carry no `application` attribute and nest under their namespace group, and the build does not fail.

#### Scenario: All families queried

- **WHEN** a graph build runs against an upstream containing all families above
- **THEN** the reader emits exactly one PromQL query per family for the build, each evaluated at the caller-supplied `end` over `end - start`

#### Scenario: Missing optional family

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_pod_info` and `kube_node_info` but no `kube_node_labels` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology with empty `labels` maps on node entities and does not fail the build

#### Scenario: Service and endpointslice metrics absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_pod_info` and `kube_node_info` but no `kube_service_info`, `kube_endpointslice_endpoints`, or `kube_endpointslice_labels` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology with empty service/endpoint indexes, the build does not fail, and any `"://"` connection-string endpoint that would otherwise resolve to an in-cluster service falls back to an `external/<label>` node with empty `labels`

#### Scenario: PVC info metric absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_pod_spec_volumes_persistentvolumeclaims_info` but no `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_info` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology in which every PVC entity has no `storageclass` attribute, carries no `volumename` or `svm` label, emits no `pvc-to-netapp-aggr` edge, the build does not fail, and the serialiser nests every PVC under its namespace group

#### Scenario: StorageClass info metric absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_storageclass_info` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader never queries the metric (it is removed from the topology fan-out), no `storageclass` entity is materialised, and PVC entities still resolve their `storageclass` attribute from `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_info`

#### Scenario: Trident custom-resource metrics absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains (or lacks) `kube_tridentvolume_info` / `kube_tridentbackend_info` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader never queries either metric (the Trident chain is removed from the topology fan-out) and the PVC `svm` label resolves solely via the `netapp-storage-graph` capability's `volume_labels` join

#### Scenario: Container info metric absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_pod_info` but no `kube_pod_container_info` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology in which every pod entity carries no `containers` attribute, and the build does not fail

#### Scenario: Node status-condition metric absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_node_info` but no `kube_node_status_condition` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology in which every K8s node entity carries no `ready_status` attribute, and the build does not fail

#### Scenario: PVC/service annotation metrics absent

- **WHEN** the upstream contains `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_info` and `kube_service_info` but no `kube_persistentvolumeclaim_annotations` or `kube_service_annotations` series for the window
- **THEN** the reader produces a valid topology in which every PVC and service entity carries no `application` attribute and nests under its namespace group, and the build does not fail

#### Scenario: Namespace-scoped series narrowed at the source

- **WHEN** a build runs with the namespace filter `shop` against an upstream holding pods in `shop` and `payments`
- **THEN** every **[AECN]** series is issued with `namespace="shop"`, every **[AEC]** series is issued without a namespace matcher, the topology holds only `shop` pods, claims, services, and endpoints, and every node of the loaded clusters

### Requirement: Series missing the cluster label

A topology series that is missing the `cluster` label SHALL be bucketed under `cluster="unknown"`. The reader SHALL surface the count of such series via the `kube_state_graph_clusters_observed` gauge (the value `unknown` will appear in the gauge's label set when present). A request-scoped `cluster` filter whose value is `unknown` SHALL be rendered as the empty-string matcher `cluster=""` — PromQL's empty-string equality matches a series that carries no such label — so the bucket remains addressable at the source; any other value renders as the literal value.

#### Scenario: Legacy series without cluster label

- **WHEN** a `kube_pod_info` series has no `cluster` label
- **THEN** the resulting pod entity has `cluster: "unknown"` and contributes to the `unknown` value in the observed-clusters set

#### Scenario: Filtering on the unknown bucket

- **WHEN** a build runs with the cluster filter `unknown` against an upstream where some `kube_pod_info` series carry no `cluster` label and others carry `cluster="cluster-alpha"`
- **THEN** the query is issued with `cluster=""`, only the unlabelled series are loaded, and the resulting pod entities all have `cluster: "unknown"`

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Request-scoped upstream selectors

The build SHALL accept four request-scoped selector dimensions — `az`, `env`, `cluster`, `namespace` — each a set of values, and SHALL render them into the upstream PromQL queries as label matchers composed **with** (never replacing) each query's fixed, request-invariant selectors (`type=~"ExternalIP|InternalIP"`, `condition="Ready"`, `lun=""`, the service-graph sentinel and `edge_relation!="link"` matchers). Which dimensions reach which series is a hardcoded contract with no configuration surface:

- `az` and `env`: every kube-state-metrics, kubelet, and NetApp Harvest series.
- `cluster`: every kube-state-metrics and kubelet series. **Never** a Harvest series — Harvest's `cluster` label names the ONTAP cluster, not a Kubernetes cluster — and never a service-graph series.
- `namespace`: every kube-state-metrics and kubelet series that carries a `namespace` label (the pod-, claim-, Service-, and EndpointSlice-scoped series). Never a node series, never a Harvest series, never a service-graph series.
- The three `traces_service_graph_*` series and the `up{}` probe SHALL carry **no** request-scoped matcher under any request.

Rendering SHALL be a pure function of the sorted, de-duplicated value set: one value renders `<key>="<value>"` (with `"` and `\` escaped); two or more render one fully-anchored alternation `<key>=~"<v1>|<v2>"` whose alternatives are regex-quoted and THEN string-escaped (a backslash introduced by regex-quoting is doubled, because a PromQL string literal rejects an unknown escape sequence); an empty set renders nothing. Matchers inside a selector SHALL appear in a fixed order (fixed selectors first, then `az`, `env`, `cluster`, `namespace`). The `cluster` value `unknown` renders `cluster=""` (see "Series missing the cluster label"). Series families that carry no request-scoped matcher for a dimension are narrowed by **reference** instead — a node is emitted only when a loaded pod is scheduled on it, an aggregate only when a loaded claim's `volumename` joins to it — as specified by the `graph-api` retention requirements.

A build with every dimension empty SHALL issue each query exactly as it is issued today. Zero rows under a non-empty dimension is a valid, empty topology — not a failure and not a retention miss.

#### Scenario: Fixed selector composed with request matchers

- **WHEN** a build runs with `az={zone-a}` and `cluster={cluster-alpha}`
- **THEN** the node-address query is issued as `last_over_time(kube_node_status_addresses{type=~"ExternalIP|InternalIP",az="zone-a",cluster="cluster-alpha"}[<window>])` and the node-condition query keeps `condition="Ready"` ahead of the request matchers

#### Scenario: Harvest receives zone and environment but not cluster or namespace

- **WHEN** a build runs with `az={zone-a}`, `env={prod}`, `cluster={cluster-alpha}`, `namespace={shop}`
- **THEN** every Harvest query (`volume_labels`, the `qos_*` families, `qos_policy_fixed_max_throughput_*`, `aggr_*`, `node_new_status`) is issued with exactly `az="zone-a",env="prod"` added (the `qos_*` families keeping `lun=""`), with no `cluster` and no `namespace` matcher

#### Scenario: Service-graph series are never narrowed

- **WHEN** a build runs with any non-empty combination of the four dimensions
- **THEN** the three `traces_service_graph_*` queries are issued exactly as for an unfiltered build (sentinel and link matchers only), and the `up{}` probe query is the bare `up`

#### Scenario: Multi-value rendering is order-free

- **WHEN** one build runs with `namespace={b, a}` and another with `namespace={a, b, a}`
- **THEN** both issue `namespace=~"a|b"` on every namespace-scoped series

#### Scenario: Regex metacharacters in a value are quoted

- **WHEN** a build runs with `env={prod.eu, prod-us}`
- **THEN** the rendered alternation is `env=~"prod-us|prod\\.eu"` — the metacharacter is regex-quoted AND the resulting backslash is escaped for the PromQL string literal, which rejects an unknown escape sequence — so a series with `env="prodXeu"` does not match

#### Scenario: Empty dimensions render nothing

- **WHEN** a build runs with all four dimensions empty
- **THEN** every issued query string is byte-identical to the query issued before request-scoped selectors existed

### Requirement: Configurable `az` / `env` label keys

The upstream label names that the `az` and `env` dimensions bind to SHALL default to `az` and `env` and SHALL be overridable per deployment via the environment variables `KSG_AZ_LABEL` / `KSG_ENV_LABEL` and the flags `--az-label` / `--env-label` (flag overrides environment, following the existing precedence). Each configured key SHALL be validated at startup as a PromQL label name (`[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z0-9_]*`); an invalid key SHALL fail startup with an error naming the setting. The two keys SHALL be distinct. The request parameter names (`az`, `env`) SHALL NOT change with the configured keys. The engine's embeddable options SHALL expose the same two keys so an in-process consumer configures them identically.

#### Scenario: Defaults apply when unset

- **WHEN** the server starts with neither variable nor flag set and a request carries `az=zone-a`
- **THEN** the rendered matcher is `az="zone-a"`

#### Scenario: Environment variable rebinds the key

- **WHEN** the server starts with `KSG_ENV_LABEL=deployment_tier` and a request carries `env=prod`
- **THEN** the rendered matcher is `deployment_tier="prod"`

#### Scenario: Invalid key fails startup

- **WHEN** the server starts with `KSG_AZ_LABEL=topology.kubernetes.io/zone`
- **THEN** startup fails with an error naming `KSG_AZ_LABEL` and stating that the value is not a valid PromQL label name

#### Scenario: Identical keys are rejected

- **WHEN** the server starts with `--az-label=scope --env-label=scope`
- **THEN** startup fails with an error stating that the two keys must differ

## REMOVED Requirements

### Requirement: Cluster discovery query

**Reason**: The query served only the removed `GET /v1/clusters` endpoint. Retaining it would require a second copy of the request-scoped selector contract for a list the graph body already carries.

**Migration**: The set of clusters with data is the `clusters` field of a `GET /v1/graph` response; the observational `kube_state_graph_clusters_observed` gauge still reports the clusters seen by the last build.
